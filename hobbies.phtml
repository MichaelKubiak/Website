                    I enjoy making cakes, biscuits, traybakes, fruit crumbles, etc. and improving on recipes that I find.  My best cakes are sponges, and I've made a lot of Victoria sponges and chocolate sponges, but have recently branched out into coffee and walnut sponges as well. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently not baking as much as I did, because I either have to eat it all myself, or transport it to work, which is difficult to do without baked goods getting ruined.

                  I have recently rediscovered watercolour, when I get time I enjoy sitting down and painting.
		</p>
		<p>
		  I mostly like to paint landscapes, like the one to the left, which I painted based on a sunrise that I saw from Therfield Heath, when my insomnia was particularly bad. When my dog, Pixel, died in June, I decided to do my best to paint her.  Even though the details are not perfect, I think that it captures her energy.

                            I collected Warhammer 40K for a long time while I was at school, painting very poorly, and playing infrequently.  I have recently started painting some of the models that I didn't get around to at that time (shown to the right).

                            During my undergrad, I would play boardgames, like Pandemic and Carcassone, with my brother, whenever we met up in person.  I now attend the campus board game evenings in Cambridge every other month, where we go to a board game cafe, and play a wide variety of games.

                        <p>
                            I have listened to actual play podcasts, among other types, for a number of years, but have only started actively participating in TTRPGs recently.  During my MSc, I gathered a group (mostly different members than the climbing group) to play a game called Blades in the Dark, which we played until December, when most of the group left the city.  We also played (remotely) a campaign of Beamsaber, and oneshots of A Quiet Year, Fiasco and Delta Green.

                            When I have time, I play various video games, both single player and multiplayer.  The latter provide good opportunities to keep in touch, and have fun, with my friends

                             My most commonly played games are roguelike and/or deckbuilding games, and role playing games, but I also play tactics games, action/fps, or any other game if it sounds interesting.

                    I learned to play the piano from a very young age (I currently have an electronic one), and have also made forays into other instruments, with less long lasting consequences.  I am looking into picking the violin up again.

                    I tend to play classical music, or music from the soundtracks of games that I particularly like, but I also experiment with other music when I come across the sheet music for it.

                    I read anything that looks interesting or fun, which normally means sci-fi/fantasy, or popular science books, but also includes some mysteries, comedies, and other genres.

                    I also listen to audiobooks and podcasts.  These can be broadly grouped into scientific, dramatic (including Actual Play), and comedic, with some overlap.

                    I have been rock climbing since 6th form, where it was offered as an optional activity for "games" each Wednesday afternoon.  A small group of us would be taken, by bus, either to a bouldering centre in Abergavenny, which is now sadly closed, or to Boulders in Cardiff, for roped climbing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my undergrad, I went bouldering with the climbing society for the first couple of years, before changing to a separate group to which my brother also belonged, to do some outdoor climbing, near Chepstow, together with more roped climbing and bouldering indoors around Bristol.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once I completed my undergrad, and through my time working at the pub, I continued to climb with this group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I moved to Leicester, I formed a small group of my classmates, mostly new to climbing, and we continued to climb together regularly throughout our time in Leicester.
                </p>
		<p>
		    I currently go bouldering with a friend regularly at the weekend.

                    During 6th form, I spent many of my Saturdays at a nearby craft shop, which had an attached space for woodworking.  I used a wood lathe to produce a number of different products, including bowls and bowling pins.  I also did some restoration of a clock, and some pyrography.  An example of my work is shown on the right.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More recently, I have been learning to carve, although I have yet to produce anything that looks remotely like I intended it to look!
