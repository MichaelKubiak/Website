1. Complete menu system:
	-	make getMenuLists only return folders with phtml or html files (not return empty arrays for other folders)
        -   bool that determines whether anything new has been added this iteration
        -   function returns null if bool is false
        -   only add the next iteration to the array if it did not return null
	-	make a template menu item
        -   <a> used in previous projects, and worked
        -   needs to be in php tags so that variables can be used to add the text and path
	-	use that template menu item in a foreach loop to produce the full menu
        -   ensure that the correct number of items are created
        -   may need multilevel menus?

2. Decide on page layout
	-	create basic layout (before the rest)
	-	---Remainder may not be set at this point
		-	colour scheme
		-	Page titles?
		-	Ensure text not too clumped - images etc. to break it up

3. Create page content
	-	Page with an image of me, maybe a little background
	-	CV section
		-	Education
		-	Work
		-	Voluntary Work
	-	Projects section
		-	Masters project
		-	Microprocessor project
		-	Website...
	-	Hobbies section?
	-	Contact Me page?

4. Mobile and other device compatibility - not a priority, but nice to have later
